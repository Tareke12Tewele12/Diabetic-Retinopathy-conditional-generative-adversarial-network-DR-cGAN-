Dear Professor, 
This project include the following folders: 

1) Deep Learning: which contains all the DL code and trained models. 
2) AIA_ML: which contains the following folders: 
   1) Code: contains all the AIA and ML code (2 jupyter notebooks) one for Red Lesions, another for Exudates. 
   2) Confidence Score: contains the confidence score of the segmented regions of the test set in excel files. 
   3) ML_TrainingSet and Model: contains the saved model and the training data after extracting them from the candidate regions of the training images (2 Excel file) 
   4) TestSet Segmented Images: contains the following folders: 
       1) Candidates: contains the canidate regions of each image of the test set after AIA. 
       2) Confidence Score Images: contains grayscale images for the candidate regions by reflecting their confidence score to belong to a particular class. 
       3) Final Segmentation: contains the segmented images of the whole test set for the 4 lesions.  			
3) the final report of the project
